# Parabola


**Parabola** is a Flutter application created during my third year at university. It was one of my first projects in Flutter, and I developed it to implement various mathematical functions commonly taught in numerical analysis courses. The app offers solutions for different methods used in solving numerical problems, making it a handy tool for students studying these concepts.


## Features

The app implements the following methods:

- **Bisection Method**
- **False Position Method**
- **Simple Fixed Point Iteration**
- **Newton's Method**
- **Secant Method**
- **Gauss Elimination**
- **LU Decomposition**
- **Cramer's Rule**
- **Gauss-Jordan Elimination**
- **Partial Pivoting**
- **Golden Section Search**
- **Gradient Method**

These methods are all used to solve numerical analysis problems, making it a useful educational tool for anyone studying the subject.

## Key Details

- **State Management**: The app does not use any state management techniques, as this was one of my first Flutter projects.
- **UI**: The user interface is basic and not over-the-top, as I focused more on functionality than design at the time.
- **Code Quality**: As a beginner project, the code is not as clean as it could be. It's a reflection of my learning process and an early attempt at using Flutter.

## Installation

To run the app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Afwra/numerical_analysis_calculator.git

2. Navigate to project directory:
   ```bash
   cd parabola

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get

3. Run the app on an emulator or connected device:
   ```bash
   flutter run
